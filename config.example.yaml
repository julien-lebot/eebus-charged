# EEBUS Charged Configuration Example
# Copy this file to config.yaml and adjust the values

# Service configuration - identifies your HEMS on the network
service:
  # Brand name visible to other EEBUS devices
  brand: "Custom HEMS"
  
  # Model name
  model: "EEBUS-CHARGED v1.0"
  
  # Serial number - MUST be unique for your installation
  # You can generate one with: uuidgen | tr -d '-' | head -c 10
  serial: "HEMS-001"
  
  # Device name visible to other devices
  device_name: "Home Energy Manager"

# Network configuration
network:
  # Port for EEBUS communication (default: 4712)
  port: 4712
  
  # Port for HTTP control API (default: 8080)
  api_port: 8080
  
  # Network interface to bind to
  # Leave empty to listen on all interfaces
  # Examples: "eth0", "en0", "wlan0"
  interface: ""

# Certificate configuration
certificates:
  # Certificates are auto-generated if not present
  # They will be stored in these paths
  cert_file: "./certs/cert.pem"
  key_file: "./certs/key.pem"

# Optional: Manually configure chargers
# Leave empty for auto-discovery via mDNS
# Only needed if:
#   - mDNS doesn't work on your network
#   - You want to use custom names instead of auto-generated ones
#   - You want to force direct IP connection
#
# chargers:
#   - name: "garage_wallbox"        # Your custom name
#     ski: "a4bd-3e46-cb83..."       # Get from logs on first connection
#     ip: "10.10.10.10"              # Optional: force direct IP
#
# If not configured, chargers auto-discover and get auto-generated names like:
#   - "charger_12345678" (from last 8 chars of SKI)
# You can then add them to config with your preferred names

# Charging parameters
charging:
  # Minimum charging current in Amperes
  # Most EVs support 6A, some can go as low as 2.2A
  min_current: 6.0
  
  # Maximum charging current in Amperes
  # This should match your electrical installation capacity
  # Common values:
  #   - 16A for standard installations
  #   - 32A for high-power installations
  #   - Check your main breaker rating
  max_current: 28.0
  
  # Default charging current in Amperes
  # Used when starting a new charging session
  default_current: 16.0
  
  # Number of phases (1 or 3)
  # 1 = single-phase (max ~7kW at 32A)
  # 3 = three-phase (max ~22kW at 32A)
  phases: 3

# Logging configuration
logging:
  # Log level: debug, info, warn, error
  # Use "debug" for troubleshooting
  # Use "info" for normal operation
  level: "info"
  
  # Log format: console, json
  # "console" is human-readable, good for interactive use
  # "json" is structured, good for log aggregation systems
  format: "console"
  
  # Optional: Log file path
  # If set, logs ONLY to file (not console)
  # Leave empty to log to console
  file: ""
  # Example: file: "/var/log/eebus-charged.log"
